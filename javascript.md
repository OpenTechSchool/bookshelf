## JavaScript Web Applications
by Alex MacCaw

If you consider yourself an intermediate user of JavaScript and you'd like to start developing complex web applications, this book is for you. It covers virtually *anything* that is relevant in JavaScript application development today, including topics like MVC architecture, dependency management, and templating. While the book explains those basic concepts in-depth, it is also very hands-on and task oriented, giving examples using various popular JavaScript libraries.
