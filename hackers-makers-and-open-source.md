## Die Hacker: von der Lust in fremden Netzen zu wildern (German)
by Werner Heine, 1985, Rowolt-Verlag

If you ever happen to come across this book, buy it - it is not printed anymore. It is an insightful book about the (german) hacker scene beginning of the 80s, its history, their ideals and methods and discusses the legal and moral questions around hacking and the "hacker revolution". And while the speed of our computers quadrupled, those topics are still as up to date as they were 30 years ago.

Plus: this books reveals in chapter 3 where the term "Hacking" actually came from. See... now you gotta get it.
